## ü§î How it works.

Putting the services to work is very easy, you just need to run this command ```docker-compose up -d --build``` in the root folder of the project.

Watch out! Before running everything make sure that ports **3306, 5672, 15672, 8080, 8081, 8083, 8089 and 9090** are free on your computer.

A code snippet that sends e-mail in the** ordering-fulfilment** service was commented, because you need to add your password and e-mail configured from the **SendGrid** service, if you want to modify it just add the information in the environment variables of the service:

`email.agent.receiving=CONFIGURE_YOUR_EMAIL`
`spring.mail.password=CONFIGURE_YOUR_PASSWORD`

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Useful information

In the *root folder* of the project there is a **postman** file with some project routes.

The service has **OAuth2** authentication, therefore, before making a new request, make sure that you have authenticated and are passing the Token `bearer` in the request.
